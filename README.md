# My Personal Portfolio Website

Hey there! 👋 This is my portfolio website. I built it because I'm a developer and we make our own things, right?

**Live at**: [abdulaziz-d.com](https://abdulaziz-d.com)

## About This Repo

It's a single-page portfolio. All my content lives in `data.json` because I like to keep things simple. When I need to update something, I just edit that one file. The site reads it and does the rest. Easy peasy.

I used the [BreezyCV template](https://themeforest.net/item/breezycv-resume-cv-template/26081195) as a starting point for the design, but then I heavily modified how it works under the hood. The looks stayed pretty similar, but the whole content loading system is my own - JSON-driven and much easier to maintain. No frameworks, no overthinking. Just works.

## SEO Stuff

I added some SEO things. Meta tags, structured data, sitemap, robots.txt - the whole package. Does it actually work? I think so? Maybe? Search engines are mysterious creatures. Let's hope Google likes it. 🤞

## About Me

I'm Abdulaziz - a cybersecurity specialist and full-stack developer. I find bugs, build things, break things (safely), and fix things. Mostly web stuff, sometimes security stuff, always learning.

I'm from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. I've been doing this for a while now, and I still enjoy it. Which is nice.
